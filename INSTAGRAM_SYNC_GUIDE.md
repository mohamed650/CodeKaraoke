# 🎵 Instagram-Style Lyrics Synchronization Guide

## Overview

Your CodeKaraoke app now features advanced lyrics synchronization similar to Instagram's music stories, with real-time audio analysis and intelligent timing that adapts to Suno-generated audio characteristics.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Audio Analysis Engine**
- **Web Audio API Integration**: Analyzes audio frequency spectrum, beats, and vocal segments
- **Tempo Detection**: Automatically detects BPM and rhythm patterns
- **Vocal Segment Recognition**: Identifies when vocals are present vs instrumental sections
- **Energy Profile**: Tracks audio intensity changes for better sync points

### 2. **Smart Timing System**
- **Adaptive Synchronization**: Adjusts to actual audio characteristics instead of simple time division
- **Vocal-Based Timing**: Aligns lyrics with detected vocal segments
- **Beat-Aware Sync**: Uses detected beats as timing anchors
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each lyric has a confidence score for timing accuracy

### 3. **Instagram-Style Display**
- **Word-by-Word Highlighting**: Individual words light up as they're sung
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated text changes with various effect styles
- **Lyric Type Classification**: Different styles for verses, chorus, bridge, intro, outro
- **Floating Words Effect**: Special animation for chorus sections
- **Beat Visualization**: Visual pulses synchronized with detected beats

### 4. **Manual Calibration System**
- **Fine-Tuning Controls**: Adjust timing by ±0.1s or ±0.5s increments
- **Sync Quality Monitor**: Real-time feedback on synchronization accuracy
- **Quick Sync Actions**: "Sync to Beat" and "Reset" options
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjustable sensitivity for sync detection

## 🎯 How It Works

### Audio Analysis Process
1. **Audio Loading**: Fetches and decodes the Suno-generated audio
2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Tempo detection using onset analysis
   - Beat detection through energy changes
   - Vocal segment identification via spectral analysis
   - RMS energy profiling
3. **Timing Calculation**: Matches lyrics to audio features intelligently

### Synchronization Algorithm
```
1. Analyze audio → Extract features (beats, vocals, energy)
2. Match lyrics → Align text with vocal segments
3. Apply weights → Consider lyric length and complexity
4. Generate timings → Create precise start/end times
5. Add confidence → Score each timing for quality
6. Enable fine-tuning → Allow manual adjustments
```

## 🎮 User Interface
